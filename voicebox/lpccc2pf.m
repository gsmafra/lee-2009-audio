function pf=lpccc2pf(cc,np,nc)
%LPCCC2PF Convert complex cepstrum to power spectrum PF=(CC,NP,NC)
% cc = complex cepstrum coefs
% np+2 = number of frequency values 0 to nyquist (default: np=size(cc,2))
% nc = number of cepstral coefs to use (default: nc=np);
% for high speed make np one less than a power of 2
