Unsupervised feature learning for audio classification using convolutional deep belief networks

Fork from the original code found in Lee's website

http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~honglak/

Trying to port to Octave and allow the use of generic databases

Original README:

>This is a matlab demo code for the algorithm described in the following paper:
>
>Unsupervised Feature Learning for Audio Classification using Convolutional Deep Belief Networks
>Honglak Lee and Yan Largman and Peter Pham and Andrew Y. Ng
>Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 22

>
>Quick instructions:
>
>1. Put TIMIT data into data/timit folder
>The full path for timit training data should be data/timit/train/...
>
>2. In matlab, run the following demo code
>demo_train
>
>
>
>If you find this code useful, please cite our paper.
